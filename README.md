README

This is a Python script that reads a text file and types its content 
into a specified field or application. It can be particularly useful 
for automating the process of entering tags from a text file into a 
field, such as when categorizing items or adding keywords to a document.

PREQUISITES

Python 3.x

pyautogui library


RUN SCRIPT USING FOLLOWING COMMAND:

python type_enter.py FILE_PATH

Replace FILE_PATH with the path to the text file containing the tags you want to enter.


IMPORTANT NOTE

Ensure that the target field or application is in focus and ready to 
receive input before running the script. Additionally, make sure that 
the file containing the tags is properly formatted, with each tag on 
a separate line.

LIMITATIONS

The script assumes that the text file is in a readable format.
It does not handle exceptions or errors that may occur during the execution.
The script may not work correctly with certain applications or interfaces that have specific input requirements.

DISCLAIMER

Please use this script responsibly and respect the terms of use and 
policies of any application or system you interact with. The 
automation of keyboard input should be used ethically and within the 
legal boundaries defined by the targeted systems.
